# STR Booking Source Analytics & CRM — PRD

## Original problem statement (verbatim)
Build a booking-source analytics and CRM tool for a short-term rental (STR)
accommodation business managing ~15 properties across multiple complexes,
receiving bookings from direct channels and OTAs (Airbnb, Booking.com, Stayz,
VRBO, Expedia). Final deployment target: Supabase (DB) + Vercel (frontend).
Multi-stage build: Stage 1 = booking source classification, Stage 2 = guest
segmentation + cancellation system, Stages 3-7 = scoring, campaigns,
analytics, tasks, calendar.

## Tech stack (locked at kickoff)
FastAPI (Python) + MongoDB + React. Original spec asked for Node + Postgres +
Supabase; user agreed to use the Emergent default stack with an explicit
porting plan documented at handoff.

## User personas
- **STR operations manager** — uploads OTA/PMS exports, reviews booking-source
  mix, manages cancellation recoveries.
- **Marketing / growth analyst** — segments guests, exports remarketing
  audiences, tracks Direct-vs-OTA revenue attribution.

## Stages shipped
| Stage | Status | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | ✅ 2026-02 | CSV import, source classification, dashboard, reservations, properties, history |
| 2 | ✅ 2026-02 | Guest profile consolidation, 12 segments, remarketing priority score, cancellation analytics, audience CSV export |
| 3 | ✅ 2026-02 | 4-score engine (direct conversion, LTV, rebooking, revenue opportunity), OTA commission tracking, configurable commission rates |
| 4 | ✅ 2026-02 | Full analytics dashboard (5 sections), 7 exportable reports, date+property filters |
| 4.5 | ✅ 2026-02 | Weekly digest via Resend — webhook-triggered, configurable recipients/schedule, trend notes, click-through links, "no new data" skip |
| 5 | ✅ 2026-02 | Campaign engine — 13 audiences across 3 tabs, configurable offer library (12 defaults), content recommendations, direct booking growth tracker, audience CSV exports |
| 6A | ✅ 2026-02 | Auth foundation — self-hosted JWT + bcrypt, three roles (admin/manager/staff), /login page, /admin/users CRUD, role-based sidebar, session restore via /api/auth/me, seed admin (`admin@sourcebench.local`) |
| 6B | ✅ 2026-02 | Property model extension (address, key/wifi/parking/lock, cleaner+manager assignees, occupancy, check-in/out times, OTA listing URLs) + Task management (`/tasks` with 8 categories, 4 statuses, 4 priorities, checklists, comments, base64 photos via browser-image-compression, RBAC: admin/manager full CRUD, staff read assigned-property tasks + complete only own) |
| 6C | ✅ 2026-02 | Compliance & housekeeping schedules — 12 default items per property (6 compliance + 6 housekeeping), auto-seeds for every property on startup, `/compliance` portfolio page + per-property panel in Properties editor, mark-done bumps `next_due_at`, auto-creates linked tasks within 14-day lead window (assignee = cleaner for housekeeping / manager for compliance), and task completion automatically advances the linked schedule via explicit `schedule_item_id` OR category+subtype+property fallback |
| 6D | ✅ 2026-02 | Apartment inventory tracker — 25 default items per property (linens, toiletries, kitchen, cleaning, electrical, first-aid), `/inventory` portfolio page + per-property panel, restock action with manager+admin gating, auto-creates `restock` category tasks when `current_count ≤ min_threshold` (assignee = cleaner / manager fallback), task completion auto-snaps count back to target. Linked via new `inventory_item_id` on tasks. Auto-seeds for every property on startup. |
| **CSV Import Refactor** | ✅ 2026-02 | Multi-platform parser (`csv_importer.py`): silent UTF-8→Latin-1 fallback + BOM strip; auto-detects Tokeet, VikBooking, Preno, Guestpoint Person Detail, Guestpoint Customer Export, Generic — with `mode: booking_import` or `profile_enrichment`. Guestpoint files now upsert into new `guest_enrichments` collection without creating reservations. Tolerance rules: never reject a file for encoding; never skip a row unless guest_name AND checkin_date are BOTH missing; auto-generate reservation_id with platform prefix when absent; null-tolerant on email, value, dates. Import UI shows detected platform + mode + per-mode preview table. |
| 6E | ✅ 2026-02 | Guest review tracker — `/reviews` portfolio page, ReviewFormModal (create/edit ≤60s, star rating, horizontal category chips, sentiment auto-suggest+override, management response, response_sent toggle, internal notes, manual priority override), Dashboard KPI card (avg rating / response rate / priority open — clickable), `/guests/{id}` reviews panel, CSV import (preview/confirm, encoding fallback via shared csv_importer). Priority auto-flag = rating ≤ 3 AND unresponded, with manual override that wins. Full RBAC: admin+manager write; staff read-only scoped to assigned_properties. 9 OTA sources + 7 category tags + 3 sentiments. |
| **Auth Hardening** | ✅ 2026-02 | JWT-gated every endpoint: AUTH_ANY (any auth) on read-only listings (`/properties`, `/sources`, `/inventory`, `/schedules`); AUTH_MGR (manager+admin) on operational CRUD (`/reservations`, `/analytics/*`, `/segments`, `/guests`, `/cancellations`, `/scores`, `/commissions`, `/reports`, `/campaigns`, `/import/*`, `/inventory` mutations, `/schedules` mutations, `/properties` POST/PUT, `/settings/commissions GET`, `/settings/offers GET`, `/settings/campaign-content GET`); AUTH_ADMIN on critical settings + digest (`/properties DELETE`, `/settings/commissions PUT`, `/settings/offers POST/PUT/DELETE`, `/settings/direct-target`, `/settings/campaign-content PUT`, `/settings/digest`, `/digest/preview`, `/digest/send-now`, `/digest/history`). `/digest/run` stays anonymous (token-based webhook by design). Frontend 401 interceptor in `lib/api.js` redirects to `/login`. Staff "/" auto-redirects to `/tasks` via Home component. |
| 7 | ✅ 2026-02 | Staff Calendar + Hours + iCal + Team Noticeboard. Staff/shifts/time-off/hours/announcements collections + services (`staff_service.py`, `hours_service.py`, `announcements_service.py`). Endpoints: `/api/staff/shifts` CRUD (mgr+ write, staff read own), `/api/staff/time-off` (staff self-serve, mgr approve/decline with mandatory reason), `/api/staff/hours` Draft→Submit→Approve/Reject flow + `/summary` (mgr+) + `/export.csv` (mgr+, week-38h overtime flag), `/api/staff/{id}/ical?token=` + `/api/staff/team/ical?token=` unauth iCal feeds (RFC 5545 all-day, dtend+1), `/api/staff/{id}/ical-info` + admin-only `/rotate-ical-token`, `/api/staff/team/ical-info` (mgr+), `/api/staff/{id}/profile` (KPIs + shifts_this_week + assigned_property_names + pending_timeoff), `/api/announcements` CRUD + `/{id}/dismiss` (per-user dismissal list, Urgent-first sort). Frontend: `/staff/calendar` (Month/Week grid + colour-coded chips + pending-request approval panel), `/staff/hours` (log-draft-submit-approve table + summary + CSV export), `/staff/:id` (profile + iCal copy/rotate), `NoticeboardCard` embedded in Dashboard AND Tasks pages (staff redirect to /tasks so both landings covered). Sidebar shows dynamic labels: "My calendar"/"My hours" for staff, "Staff calendar"/"Staff hours" for admin/manager. Managers hit `/users/assignable` (not admin-only `/users`). Pytest suite `backend/tests/test_stage7_staff_calendar.py` — **50/50 pass**. |
| 8 | ✅ 2026-02 | Stage 8 — Operational backbone. **(1) RoomMaster webhook**: `POST /api/roommaster/webhook` unauthenticated by JWT, guarded by `X-RoomMaster-API-Key` header (env `ROOMMASTER_WEBHOOK_SECRET`), validates payload + resolves property_name → property_id, upserts on `reservation_id` (same key as Stage 1 CSV import so all downstream analytics/scoring/segments work unchanged), logs every hit to `roommaster_webhook_logs` (`GET /api/roommaster/logs` mgr+). **(2) Guest Inbox**: `inbox_messages` collection with thread_id conversations, `/api/inbox` CRUD + filters (status/sentiment/property/date_range) + 3-char debounced search + `/{id}/read`, `/{id}/archive`, `/{id}/draft-reply` (AI STUBBED per user choice — returns "coming soon" marker), `/{id}/send-reply` via Resend (reuses Stage 4.5 config, records outbound message on same thread, marks original Replied even if Resend errors). **(3) Command Centre** `/api/command-centre` + `/dashboard/command-centre` — 6 streams: 7-day check-in/check-out weekly table, overdue+due-today tasks, payment-follow-ups Stage-9 placeholder, guest-followups (Replied but >48h idle), unread messages, paddle bookings today. **(4) Paddle & Pedal** `paddle_bookings` collection, `/api/paddle` CRUD + `/paddle` page with date/activity/status filters + bulk-complete. **(5) Seasonal Pricing** `pricing_calendar` collection (unique index on property_id+date), `/api/pricing` list/upsert/bulk-import/export.csv/calc, `/pricing` page with month-grid × property matrix, season colour legend, per-cell modal, CSV import/export. Auto-suggests peak/shoulder/off/holiday seasons for AU calendar. **(6) Notifications**: bell icon in sidebar + mobile top bar with unread badge, `/api/notifications` list/read/read-all, auto-emits on inbox create (urgent title when sentiment=negative), APScheduler jobs at 08:00 (`check_overdue_tasks`, `check_turnovers`) + 02:00 (`cleanup_expired_notifications`) Australia/Melbourne tz, 24h auto-expiry. Env: `ROOMMASTER_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, reuses `RESEND_API_KEY`. Services: `roommaster_service.py`, `inbox_service.py`, `paddle_service.py`, `pricing_service.py`, `notifications_service.py`. Pytest `backend/tests/test_stage8.py` — **49/49 pass**, Stage 7 regression — **50/50 pass**. Frontend E2E — 100% across admin/manager/staff. |
| 9 | Backlog | Notion quotes tool (guest quote generation → email → track quote replies via inbox), Payment follow-ups collection + UI (Stream 3 placeholder becomes live), Weekly digest v2, mobile push notifications, two-way RoomMaster sync, global search. |

## Architecture
### Backend (`/app/backend/`)
- `server.py` — FastAPI app, `/api` prefix, MongoDB via Motor.
- `segmentation_service.py` — pure functions for profile build, segment rules
  (`SEGMENT_RULES` list = single source of truth), priority score,
  `recompute_all_guests(db)`.
- `cancellation_service.py` — read-only analytics + audience CSV export.

#### Endpoints
**Stage 1**: `GET /api/`, `GET /api/sources`, `POST /api/import/preview`,
`POST /api/import/confirm`, `GET /api/reservations`,
`PATCH /api/reservations/{id}/source`, `GET /api/imports`,
`GET /api/analytics/summary`, `GET|POST|DELETE /api/properties`.

**Stage 2**: `POST /api/guests/recompute`, `GET /api/guests`,
`GET /api/guests/{email}`, `GET /api/segments`,
`GET /api/cancellations/summary`, `GET /api/cancellations`,
`GET /api/cancellations/export.csv`.

**Stage 3**: `POST /api/scores/recalculate`, `GET /api/scores/summary`,
`GET /api/scores/guests`, `GET /api/scores/guests/export.csv`,
`GET /api/commissions/summary`, `GET|PUT /api/settings/commissions`.

**Stage 4**: `GET /api/analytics/{revenue|bookings|guests|conversion|clv}`
(supports `?preset`, `?start_date`, `?end_date`, `?property_name`),
`GET /api/reports` (list), `GET /api/reports/{key}/count`,
`GET /api/reports/{key}.csv`. Reports include: full guest database, OTA
commission period, cancellation period, revenue by source period, top
conversion opportunities, guests at risk of churning, high-intent
cancellations.

Auto-recompute hooks fire after every `/api/import/confirm` and every
`PATCH /api/reservations/{id}/source` → both `recompute_all_guests` AND
`recalculate_all_scores` chained.

### Frontend (`/app/frontend/src/`)
React 19 + react-router 7 + shadcn/ui + recharts + sonner + tailwind.
Dark luxury analytics theme. Pages: `/` Analytics Dashboard (5 tabs:
Revenue, Bookings, Guests, Conversion, Lifetime value) · `/reservations` ·
`/segments` · `/scores` · `/cancellations` · `/reports` · `/import` ·
`/properties` · `/history` · `/guests/:id` · `/settings/commissions`.

## Database collections (MongoDB)
- **reservations** — id, reservation_id (unique upsert key), guest_*,
  property_name, dates, nights, guest_count, booking_value,
  raw_booking_source, classified_source, booking_date, is_cancelled,
  imported_at, manually_overridden.
- **import_logs** — id, filename, imported_at, total_rows, successful_rows,
  failed_rows, status.
- **properties** — id, name (unique), notes, created_at.
- **guests** *(Stage 2)* — id (= lowercase email), email, first_name,
  last_name, initials, total_stays, lifetime_spend, first_stay_date,
  last_stay_date, most_used_source, primary_channel (Direct|OTA|Unknown),
  properties[], cancellation_count, cancellation_rate, avg_booking_value,
  avg_length_of_stay, recovered, remarketing_priority_score (0-100),
  segments[], updated_at.

## Segment rules (Stage 2 — `segmentation_service.SEGMENT_RULES`)
**Standard (8)**: Direct Loyal Guest · OTA Loyal Guest · OTA First-Time Guest
· OTA Repeat Guest · High Value Direct Guest · High Value OTA Guest · OTA
Guest Most Likely to Convert · Direct Guest at Risk of Churning.
**Cancellation (4)**: Cancelled — High Intent · Cancelled — Repeat Canceller
· Cancelled — Recovered Guest · Cancelled — OTA Winback Target.

A guest can hold zero-to-many segments. All rules use cross-cohort context
(lifetime spend p75, avg booking value median, cancelled value median).
Edit a predicate in `SEGMENT_RULES` to retune without touching engine code.

## Remarketing priority score (Stage 2)
Integer 0-100. Zero if no cancellations. Otherwise:
- Cancelled value vs median: up to 30 pts (linear: 0 → 2× median → 30 pts).
- Recency of last cancellation: up to 25 pts (≤90d full, sliding to 0 at
  24mo+).
- Recovery bonus: +20 if cancelled then later completed.
- OTA cancellation bonus: +15.
- Repeat-canceller penalty: −20 if 2+ cancels & zero completed.

## Verified (testing agent)
- Iteration 1 (Stage 1): 10/10 tests pass.
- Iteration 2 (Stage 2): 22/22 tests pass + Stage 1 regression. Frontend
  /segments, /guests/:email, /cancellations all render and function
  correctly. Auto-recompute triggers on import & override verified.

## Handoff notes (Vercel + Supabase port)
- Endpoints map 1:1 to Postgres tables. The `guests` table becomes a
  materialised view (or scheduled recompute job) since it's derived state.
- Classification + segmentation are pure Python — easy to port to a
  Postgres function, Node service, or Supabase Edge Function.
- Frontend uses `process.env.REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL`; set for the deployed
  API origin on Vercel.

## Known by-design behaviour
- A guest whose sole cancellation value equals the cancelled-value median
  exactly is not assigned `Cancelled — High Intent` (spec says "above
  overall median"; strict `>`). Once two or more cancellers exist this
  resolves naturally.
